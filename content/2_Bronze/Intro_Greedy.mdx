# Greedy Algorithms

Some USACO Bronze problems that appear to be ad hoc can actually be solved using
**greedy** algorithms. This idea will be covered in a future
[module](/silver/greedy-sorting), but we'll introduce the general mindset in
this section.

<Resources>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="6.1 - Coin Problem" starred>
		other examples are outside scope of bronze
	</Resource>
</Resources>

<Warning>

True **"greedy"** problems start to show up in silver, though the greedy mindset
can be very helpful for bronze problems.

</Warning>

From the above:

> choice that looks the best at the moment. A greedy algorithm never takes back
> its choices, but directly constructs the final solution. For this reason,
> greedy algorithms are usually very efficient.

**Greedy** does not refer to a single algorithm, but rather a way of thinking
that is applied to problems; there's no one way to do greedy algorithms. Hence,
we use a selection of well-known examples to help you understand the greedy
paradigm.

### Explanation

In this problem, the correct greedy solution is to continually flip the longest
possible ranges of mismatching cows.

Mad Scientist has an excellent
[editorial](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_breedflip_bronze_feb20.html)
with a video solution and intuitive proof.

It is highly recommended you read it to gain a better understanding of the
greedy algorithm.

### Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;

int main() {
	int cow_num;
	std::ifstream read("breedflip.in");
	read >> cow_num;
	vector<char> a(cow_num);
	for (char &c : a) { read >> c; }
	vector<char> b(cow_num);
	for (char &c : b) { read >> c; }

	// diff[i] is true if the cows differ at the ith position
	// notice that there's an extra false at the beginning
	vector<bool> diff(cow_num + 1);
	for (int i = 0; i < cow_num; i++) { diff[i + 1] = a[i] != b[i]; }

	/*
	 * count the number of times [false, true] occurs in diff
	 * this is equivalent to the number of continous segments of trues
	 * that extra false at the beginning comes in handy here,
	 * since if we didn't have it we've have to have an edge case for
	 * the first segment that doesn't have a preceding false
	 */
	int min_flips = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < cow_num; i++) {
		if (!diff[i] && diff[i + 1]) { min_flips++; }
	}

	std::ofstream("breedflip.out") << min_flips << endl;
}
```

<JavaSection>

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class BreedFlip {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader read = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("breedflip.in"));
		int cowNum = Integer.parseInt(read.readLine());
		String a = read.readLine();
		String b = read.readLine();

		// diff[i] is true if the cows differ at the ith position
		// notice that there's an extra false at the beginning
		boolean[] diff = new boolean[cowNum + 1];
		for (int i = 0; i < cowNum; i++) { diff[i + 1] = a.charAt(i) != b.charAt(i); }

		/*
		 * count the number of times [false, true] occurs in diff
		 * this is equivalent to the number of continous segments of trues
		 * that extra false at the beginning comes in handy here,
		 * since if we didn't have it we've have to have an edge case for
		 * the first segment that doesn't have a preceding false
		 */
		int minFlips = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < cowNum; i++) {
			if (!diff[i] && diff[i + 1]) { minFlips++; }
		}

		PrintWriter written = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("breedflip.out"));
		written.println(minFlips);
		written.close();
	}
}

```py

	cow_num = int(f.readline())
	a = f.readline().strip()
	b = f.readline().strip()

# diff[i] is true if the cows differ at the ith position
# notice that there's an extra false at the beginning
diff = [False for _ in range(cow_num + 1)]
for i in range(cow_num):
	diff[i + 1] = a[i] != b[i]

Note that not all greedy problems necessarily require mathematical proofs of
correctness. It is often sufficient to intuitively convince yourself your
algorithm is correct.

Sometimes, if the algorithm is easy enough to implement, you don't even need to
convince yourself it's correct; just code it and see if it passes. Competitive
programmers refer to this as "Proof by AC," or "Proof by Accepted."

  <Quiz.Question>
    What is a greedy algorithm?
    <Quiz.Answer>
      An algorithm that backtracks in order to find the most optimal solution.
      <Quiz.Explanation>
        Incorrect. Greedy algorithms do not backtrack.
      </Quiz.Explanation>
    </Quiz.Answer>
    <Quiz.Answer correct>
      An algorithm that makes the locally optimal choice at each stage.
      <Quiz.Explanation>
        Correct. This allows a greedy algorithm to be very efficient and often easier to code.
      </Quiz.Explanation>
    </Quiz.Answer>
    <Quiz.Answer>
      An algorithm that tries every possible combination in order to find the most optimal outcome.
      <Quiz.Explanation>
        Incorrect. This is known as [complete search](/bronze/intro-complete) or [brute force](/bronze/intro-complete).

  <Quiz.Question>
    Why would a greedy algorithm be preferred over a complete search algorithm when faced with a large input size?
    <Quiz.Answer correct>
      Since greedy algorithms directly construct an answer, greedy algorithms are generally more efficient.

        Correct.
