## Explanation

The somewhat weird observation we have to make here is that the replacement process
can be thought of as Bs "eating" As and leaving Cs where they once were.

This process is shown most clearly in the 5th sample test case:
```
AAAAAAB
AAAAABC
AAAABCC
...
BCCCCCC
```
Since Bs leave Cs behind when they eat an A, they have to choose one direction and commit to it.

With that, all we need is this info:
1. How many "runs" of As there are and their sizes
2. How many Bs there are that are adjacent to a run of As.

Notice that since the initial string can only alternate between As and Bs,
there can be at most one more run of As then there are available Bs.

If this is the case, we have to give up the smallest run of As that occurs.
If not, though, we can output the sum of all the runs of As- that is,
the total number of As in the string.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(|s|)$

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;

int main() {
	int test_num;
	std::cin >> test_num;
	for (int t = 0; t < test_num; t++) {
		std::string str;
		std::cin >> str;
		str += 'X';  // Add an X for convenience in the below for loop

		int b_amts = 0;
		vector<int> a_runs;
		int a_total = 0;

		char last = str[0];
		int run_len = 1;
		for (int i = 1; i < str.size(); i++) {
			if (str[i] != last) {
				if (last == 'A') {
					a_runs.push_back(run_len);
					a_total += run_len;
				} else if (last == 'B') {
					// Any run of Bs can have at most 2 adjacent to As
					b_amts += std::min(run_len, 2);
				}
				run_len = 0;
			}
			last = str[i];
			run_len++;
		}

		// Apply formula described in explanation above
		if (b_amts < a_runs.size()) {
			int exclude = *std::min_element(a_runs.begin(), a_runs.end());
			cout << a_total - exclude << '\n';
		} else {
			cout << a_total << '\n';
		}
	}
}
