[Official Analysis (C++)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_revegetate_bronze_feb19.html)

## Explanation

We loop through all the pastures, assigning each the lowest color
that doesn't conflict with any of the requirements.

## Implementation

In the below implementation, it's made sure that the lower pastures
are put before higher pastures in the `cows` array.

This allows us to only check for one-way conflicts,
since we assign the colors from lowest to highest.

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(NM)$

<Spoiler title="Solution 2">

## Explanation

We can iterate through the favorite pastures, and increment one to the pasture with the greater index, making the result minimal.
All pastures start with grass type 1, and we only increment when we have to so the result is as small as possible.

We'll also cycle through the previous favorite pastures to make sure
new changes don't mess up previous ones.

	for (auto &[p1, p2] : cows) {
		read >> p1 >> p2;
		p1--;
		p2--;
		if (p1 > p2) { std::swap(p1, p2); }
	}

	vector<int> pastures(pasture_num, 1);

	// Assign the pastures at the front first.
	std::sort(cows.begin(), cows.end());
	for (int c = 0; c < cow_num; c++) {
		const auto &[a, b] = cows[c];
		if (pastures[a] != pastures[b]) { continue; }

		// Increment one to the later pasture
		pastures[b]++;

		// All favorite pastures up to the current one.

<Spoiler title="Solution 3 (Faster)">

## Explanation

As in solution 1, we loop through all the pastures, assigning each the lowest color
that doesn't conflict with any of the requirements. However, instead of looping
through all requirements, we instead only iterate through those requirements
for which the current pasture is the greater one.

We can do this efficiently by storing the input
with [adjacency lists](/bronze/intro-graphs#constructing-adjacency-lists).

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N+M)$

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	ifstream fin("revegetate.in");
	ofstream fout("revegetate.out");

	int N, M;
	fin >> N >> M;
	vector<vector<int>> adj(N);
	for (int e = 0; e < M; ++e) {
		int a, b;
		fin >> a >> b;
		--a, --b;
		adj.at(max(a, b)).push_back(min(a, b));
	}

	const int MAX_COLORS = 4;
	vector<int> color(N, 1);
	for (int b = 0; b < N; ++b) {
		assert(size(adj.at(b)) < MAX_COLORS);
		vector<bool> used(MAX_COLORS + 1);
		for (int a : adj.at(b)) { used.at(color.at(a)) = true; }
		while (used.at(color.at(b))) { ++color.at(b); }
		fout << color.at(b);
