## Explanation

Let $\texttt{posA}[i]$ denote the position of cow $i$ in array $\texttt{A}$ and
$\texttt{posB}[i]$ denote the position of cow $i$ in array $\texttt{B}$ (where
arrays $\texttt{A}$ and $\texttt{B}$ represent the two sides of the road).
Observe that two cows $i$ and $j$ will cross if
$\texttt{posA}[i] < \texttt{posA}[j]$ and $\texttt{posB}[i] > \texttt{posB}[j]$.

We can use the above fact to compute the initial number of crossings. Using an
Order Statistics Tree, we can initially store all
$\texttt{posB}[\texttt{A}[i]]$. To obtain the number of cows that cross with cow $i$, we can erase all $\texttt{posB}[\texttt{A}[j]]$ such that $j < i$
and query for the number of elements in the tree that are less than $\texttt{posB}[\texttt{A}[i]]$. To optimize erasing, we can loop from $1$ to $N$ and erase each $\texttt{posB}[\texttt{A}[i]]$ before each query.

To handle cyclic shifts, we only care about moving the first cow to the
last position. All other crossings will hold constant. Consider shifting
array $\texttt{B}$ to the left:

- To detach existing crossings from $\texttt{B}[1]$, we must subtract
  $\texttt{posA}[\texttt{B}[1]]$ because we know for all positions $j$ such that
  $j < \texttt{posA}[\texttt{B}[1]]$, $\texttt{A}[j]$ is attached to some
  position $\texttt{B}[k]$ such that $k > 1$.
- Now, $\texttt{B}[1]$ becomes $\texttt{B}[N]$. The number of new crossings is
  $N - \texttt{posA}[\texttt{B}[N]]$ because we know for all positions $j$ such
  that $j > \texttt{posA}[\texttt{B}[N]]$, $\texttt{A}[j]$ is attached to some
  position $\texttt{B}[k]$ such that $k < N$.

Our answer is the minimum crossings out of all cyclic shifts.
Note that we may have to consider shifting $A$ as well.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
using namespace std;
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
using ll = long long;

template <typename T>
using ordered_set =
    tree<T, null_type, less<T>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update>;

int main() {
	ifstream cin("mincross.in");
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	vector<int> a(n);
	for (int &i : a) {
		cin >> i;
		i--;
	}
	vector<int> b(n);
	for (int &i : b) {
		cin >> i;
		i--;
	}

	ll final_ans = LLONG_MAX;
	for (int iter = 0; iter < 2; iter++) {
		vector<int> pos_a(n), pos_b(n);
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			pos_a[a[i]] = i;
			pos_b[b[i]] = i;
		}

		// compute initial crossings
		ll crossings = 0;
		ordered_set<int> oset;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { oset.insert(pos_b[i]); }
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			oset.erase(pos_b[a[i]]);
			crossings += oset.order_of_key(pos_b[a[i]]);
		}

		ll ans = crossings;
		// how many crossings after we perform i + 1 cyclic shifts?
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			crossings -= pos_a[b[i]];
			crossings += n - pos_a[b[i]] - 1;
			ans = min(ans, crossings);
		}

		final_ans = min(ans, final_ans);
		swap(a, b);  // after first iteration, consider shifting array a instead
	}

	ofstream("mincross.out") << final_ans << endl;
}
